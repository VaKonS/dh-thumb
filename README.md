Adds thumbnails to drawings for "Drawing Hand Screen Saver" by Jeff Newman (http://www.drawinghand.com).<br>
(I don't develope the screensaver, it's just a helping utility).

This software is public domain.

To compile, you'll need [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and [TCLAP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tclap/) packages.
